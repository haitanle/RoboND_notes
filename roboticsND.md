# Setting up RoboND Environment
git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Python-StarterKit.git  
cd RoboND-Python-StarterKit
Windows: rename meta_window_patch.yml to meta.yml
# create env
conda env create -f environment.yml
#verify
conda info --envs
#clean
conda clean -tp
#Activate
source activate RoboND
# or
activate RoboND
#delete
conda env removee -n RoboND

Robotics Information
__________________________________________________________
Perception - Decision Making - Actuation
Each step in ROS breaks down the fundamentals to a node
Node -- Small unix processes that covers a small and relatively specific portion of the robots overall functionality
ROS Master - Maintains active registry of all nodes on the system - Hosts the parameter server which stores params and config values amongst nodes.
    Responsible for:
        Providing naming and registration services to other running nodes
        Tracking all publishers and subscribers
        Aggregating log messages generated by the nodes
        Facilitating connections between nodes
    Executed with roscore
Nodes pass messages via Topics
Topics must be subscribed to 
Nodes can Publish and Subscribe (Pub/Sub Architecture)
Message Types: Predefined message types 
    Sensor
    Physical Quantities
    Custom
Messages can contain any type of data
    img data
    json
Services - allow passing of messages
    1:1 basis using request/response architecture
Compute Graphs - Shows relationships between nodes - typically a diagram

ROS Commands and stuff
__________________________________________________________
env -- changes to environment
roscore  -- To run the master process, you must execute the command roscore
rosrun  --  running nodes, like --  rosrun turtlesim turtlesim-node
rosnode list -- returns a list of all nodes that are active and have been registered with the ROS Master
rostopic list -- query the ROS Master for a list of all topics
rostopic info /path/to/topic
rosmsg show  -- shows message output
rosed -- view and edit files in ros env
    ** this is handy to see the commented code 
    ** that explains the message
rostopic echo /path/to/topic -- view in real time the content of the messages
Catkin Workspaces - All of the ROS related code you develop throughout this course will reside in your catkin workspace.
    top-level directory is usually *  catkin_ws  *
    sub directory is *  src  *
catkin_init_workspace  (inside src directory)  check out more here: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/conceptual_overview
catkin_make   (in /catkin_ws  directory)
    2 new directories
        build -- build space for the c++ packages
        devel -- contains setup.bash which must be sourced prior to using the workspace
Familiarize with conventional dir structure here: http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0128.html
cloned git clone https://github.com/udacity/simple_arm_01.git simple_arm into the src directory
making now will cause a dependency error so installed this first...
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-controller-manager
catkin_make
roslaunch -- Allows
    Launching ROS Master and multiple nodes with 1 command
    Set auto params on the parameter server
    automatically re-spawn processes that have died
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch simple_arm robot_spawn.launch
************ The launch trifecta - each time you want to run it  ***********************
~/catkin_ws   =>  catkin_make
~/catkin_ws   =>  source devel/setup.bash
~/catkin_ws   =>  roslaunch simple_arm robot_spawn.launch
