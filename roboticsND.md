Robotics Information
__________________________________________________________
Perception - Decision Making - Actuation
Each step in ROS breaks down the fundamentals to a node
Node -- Small unix processes that covers a small and relatively specific portion of the robots overall functionality
ROS Master - Maintains active registry of all nodes on the system - Hosts the parameter server which stores params and config values amongst nodes.
    Responsible for:
        Providing naming and registration services to other running nodes
        Tracking all publishers and subscribers
        Aggregating log messages generated by the nodes
        Facilitating connections between nodes
    Executed with roscore
Nodes pass messages via Topics
Topics must be subscribed to 
Nodes can Publish and Subscribe (Pub/Sub Architecture)
Message Types: Predefined message types 
    Sensor
    Physical Quantities
    Custom
Messages can contain any type of data
    img data
    json
Services - allow passing of messages
    1:1 basis using request/response architecture
Compute Graphs - Shows relationships between nodes - typically a diagram

ROS Commands and stuff
__________________________________________________________

12. Turtlesim Comms: List All Active Nodes

    rosnode list - view active *nodes* and that is registered with ROS Master 
        /rosout - node launch by roscore. Subscribes to the standard/rosout topic, the topic which all nodes send log messages

13. Turtlesim Comms: List Topics

    rostopic list - view all topics
        /rosout_agg - feed messages published to /rosout
        /turtle1/cmd_vel - topic which velocity commands are sent/receieved. move turtle1
        /turtle1/color_sensor - color sensor of turtle topic 
        /turtle1/pose - position and orientation of turtle1 topic

14. Turtlesim Comms: Get Topic

    rostopic info [topic] - get information about a topic, publisher, subscriber, message type


15. Turtlesim Comms: Message Info

    rosmsg info [message-type]
    example) rosmsg info geometry_msgs/Twist

    more info:  rosed [message-type]


16. Turtlesim Comms: Echo a Topic

    rostopic echo - view topic published in real time


rosnode list - view active *nodes* and that is registered with ROS Master 
rostopic list - view all topics
rostopic info [topic] - get information about a topic, publisher, subscriber, message
 type
rosmsg info [message-type] - get information about a topic data type
rosed [message-type] - get more info about topic data type
rostopic echo - view topic published in real time

Catkin workspace
_____________________________________________________________________
workspace in which all code source and build will go
Setup workspace
    1st) mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    2nd) catkin_init_workspace (inside src folder)
            -create symbolic link CMakeLists.txt
            -used for sofware build,test,package
    3rd) catkin_make (inside catkin_ws)
            -build catkin workspace, run packages, create setup.bash
    4th) source devel/setup.bash
            -setup workspace env

Build folder is used for c++ package
Devel folder contains setup.bash, packages, dependencies
src contains the packages when building
    
Git clone package into src folder then 'catkin_make' (inside catkin_ws) to build package
Rebuild each time new package is added

After setup environment and source setup, run roslaunch
    -launch ros master and multiple nodes
    -setup default parameters on the parameter server
    -automatically re-spawn process that have died
ex) roslaunch simple_arm robot_spawn.launch

Gazebo is a environment simulation. 

ros has build and runtime dependencies. 
rosdep will check for missing dependencies. 
    rosdep check [package]
then install
    rosdep install -i [package]
